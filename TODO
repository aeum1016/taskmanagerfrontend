Task manager:

Should create itinerary for the next day. And constantly update with new tasks.

When tasks become events in gcal, mark in db to show they've been updated to events w/ gcal eventid.
Itinerary is pulled directly from gcal rather than from the db. Create view in db sorted by priority value.

Use summary, (start/end).dateTime, description,

Get id from response to put in db.

Use patch or get+update to do updates. patch uses 1.5x units

- Both of these should be called through one fetch

Tasks not in today or tomorrow's itinerary, shown in a list sorted by priority (Editable through the site)
